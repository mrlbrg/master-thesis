% Other data strcutured than B-Tree that have more batching effect
% Use levelling that keeps inserting into another level if write amplification is too high. Better batching.
% When the Delta Tree gets too big, we just transfer random writes from one tree to another.
% Therefore it only makes sense to track small changes. If a page has a lot of changes, it is better to write it out and not track it anymore.
